# Streaming-Ratings---Web-Scrapper
Web-Scrappes MyAnimeList for recently active users' rating data. The file "UserScrapper" obtains the names of recently active users. The file "ListScrapper-API" and "ListScrapper-noAPI" scrappes users' anime lists. Options are included to scrappe using both an internal endpoint that resembles an API or the regular public user lists' URL.
